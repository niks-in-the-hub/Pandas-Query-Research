#creating dataset with random integers using numpy function

We can create a dataset by generating random integers. Here, we create 4 columns, namely A, B, C, D. The integers are within the range 0 and 100.

df.head(50) creates first 50 i.e, 0 to 49 rows. And it fills in values to all four column with random integers from 0 to 100, as specified.

#Specify and only request for a chunk of the dataset
